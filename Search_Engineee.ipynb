But then   I m not the director of this act.                                       In Amanat Khan s treasure of ragas                                       I m one of the seven notes  like the rest of you.                                       Let s gather everyone  and begin the musical game.                                       Naad.                                       Shruti                                        Where are you taking me                                        Alap.                                       Rudrabhairav  it ll be a grave sin.                                       The holy temple of Rudrapur  contaminated by a whore.                                       Hey                                        I ll bury you alive  if you insult my mom again.                                       Is this what you have taught your son                                        Shame on you                                        It is an unforgivable sin  Rudrabhairav.                                       You can t create an idol of Goddess Durga  without soil from a brothel.                                       We must tolerate this sin  for some more time.                                       Maestro Sasikanta  you here                                        Yes  me.                                       I m the director.                                       The master.                                       The master of Rudrapur.                                       Your master Kedar Mishra...                                       was once the Naad of Rudrapur.                                       I was the Rudrabhairav then.                                       Please release me now.                                       But you are...                                       you re associated  with Gandhargarh School of Music.                                       I deceived you.                                       Besides my music...                                       I got involved in a murder  in my youth.                                       I had also vexed  an influential person.                                       He had provided the police  with evidence against me.                                       If they caught me   they wouldn t just have buried me.                                       They would ve hanged me to death.                                       So he ran away from Rudrapur                                       and took refuge in Gandhargarh.                                       Then I took on a new name...                                       Sasikanta Bharadwaj.                                       Soon  I had fame  glory  respect.                                       But Master always maintained ties  with Rudrapur.                                       When Hemanta was in police custody...                                        one of our followers saw the symbol  of the rudrabina on his back.                                        He had informed us about it.                                        I ve told you the secrets  of your master.                                        I know that your peers  are defaming you.                                        You were meant to receive  the national music award this year.                                        But Ranjan Ghosh got it instead of you.                                        Don t you want revenge                                         Yes  I do.                                        Then                                         This is your golden opportunity.                                        Join us.                                        What do I have to do                                         First of all  tell us...                                        who else among your peers  has this symbol on their body                                         Um...                                        Yes...                                        An old servant of the house  called Anadi.                                        So you forced Anadi...                                        to reveal all the names  and had them murdered.                                        You also verified the names  with a DNA test  right                                         Wow                                         You know this as well                                         I ve never seen a detective who sings.                                        Yes I did it.                                        I did it because unnecessary bloodshed  goes against our morality.                                        My goodness                                         Morality                                         Isn t lying against your morality                                         You knew nothing about the notation.  You lied.                                        I admit it...                                        I admit I lied to you.                                        Amanat Khan used his brains  to compose it.                                        You used your brains to find it.                                        And I used my brains to copy it.                                        What a brilliant composition                                         You re...                                        You re such a renowned musician.                                        You re our country s pride.                                        But you re so greedy.                                        Greedy                                         No.                                        I m not that greedy.                                        Believe me.                                        It s just that...                                        I m greedy for my life.                                        The fame  glory and wealth  which I ve earned throughout my life...                                        I want it all forever.                                        I m scared of death.                                        I can t share my glory with anyone.                                        I can t share it.                                        I m the absolute authority of Rudrapur.                                        Huge as the Himalayas.                                        Vast as the seas.                                        That s why I want  Tansen s Raga Sanjivani.                                        I ll...                                        I ll be immortal.                                        I ll be immortal.                                        I know that it s not possible.                                        But I crave it.                                        It s the only thing I want.                                        I want to be immortal.                                        An artist becomes immortal  through his creations.                                        A greedy person like you  can never create something.                                        I know that                                         I know everything.                                        I ve seen the world  long before you.                                        I know that an artist becomes  immortal through his creations.                                        You can t create something  with a greedy mind.                                        But this coming from a foolish guy  like you is funny.                                        It s funny.                                        This is the Shiva lake.                                        Let s see you if you can find  Raga Sanjivani here.                                        Look for it.                                         In the heart of Rudrapur  lies a Shiva lake.                                        When the discs are aligned                                        And the notes are played  at twice the pace of time                                        Raga Sanjivani you shall find.                                         I know all that.                                        We ve followed the notation  but nothing happened.                                        You people play it now.                                        The discs are already in place.                                        Start playing.                                        What s this  Bahadur                                         This was designed  by Madhubanti s grandfather.                                        Came to know about it  from the map of the temple.                                        Basically  if the instruments are played  according to this notation...                                        then we ll find Raga Sanjivani.                                         And the notes are played  at twice the pace of time                                        Raga Sanjivani you shall find.                                         Hmm.                                        But why  at twice the pace of time                                          Look  Shruti.                                        The normal tempo of time  is    beats per minute.                                        So   twice the pace of time  would be...                                        Sixty into two.                                          As in      beats per minute.    Right                                         So  basically...                                        if the notation is played  at     beats per minute on every instrument                                        then we ll find Raga Sanjivani.                                        Sarod.                                        Sitar.                                        Flute.                                        Santoor.                                        Shehnai.                                        Sarangi  rudrabina.                                        I get it.                                        But who will play the rudrabina                                         A whore will play the rudrabina                                         Is there any other way                                         But...                                        But...                                        H How did Rohini learn  to play the rudrabina                                         Pandit Kedar Mishra secretly taught you  to play the rudrabina.                                        Isn t it  Mom                                         Hmmph                                         Rohini...                                        the rudrabina is the king  of all instruments.                                        Earlier...                                        maestros taught the rudrabina  only to their sons or sons in law.                                        At my first music school...                                        girls were forbidden to touch  the rudrabina.                                        But I don t obey these rules now.                                        Among my students...                                        you re the only one who is worthy  of learning the rudrabina.                                        But...                                        you need a pure mind  to play the rudrabina.                                        If you play it with an impure mind...                                        a curse will befall you.                                        Nobody can escape the curse.                                        Nobody.                                          What happened  Master     Hmm                                         My master Amanat Khan...                                        gave me special instructions  while teaching the rudrabina.                                        He asked me to teach you  the rudrabina.                                        But don t tell anybody about it.                                        Got it                                         No one lives in this house now.                                        Come secretly and take lessons  in the rudrabina from me.                                        Okay                                         There ll be some magic today.                                        Record everything.

Don t come near me... Saaz I... Just get lost Go away. Love my foot You can never love anyone. You can only harass people. You can only break a glass with your songs. Can you win over people with your music like Alap can Hey Shut up Challenge You up for it Yes I am. Are you ready Take me to the Shiva Temple. Let s see who finds Raga Sanjivani. Bring them to the temple. Come. Welcome. CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA PART Come in. Welcome to the Shiva Temple of Rudrapur. What s going on You re here as well Yes. It s me. I m like the tanpura. I guide the musician from the background. But then I m not the director of this act. In Amanat Khan s treasure of ragas I m one of the seven notes like the rest of you. Let s gather everyone and begin the musical game. Naad. Shruti Where are you taking me Alap. Rudrabhairav it ll be a grave sin. The holy temple of Rudrapur contaminated by a whore. Hey I ll bury you alive if you insult my mom again. Is this what you have taught your son Shame on you It is an unforgivable sin Rudrabhairav. You can t create an idol of Goddess Durga without soil from a brothel. We must tolerate this sin for some more time. Maestro Sasikanta you here Yes me. I m the director. The master. The master of Rudrapur. Your master Kedar Mishra... was once the Naad of Rudrapur. I was the Rudrabhairav then. Please release me now. But you are... you re associated with Gandhargarh School of Music. I deceived you. Besides my music... I got involved in a murder in my youth. I had also vexed an influential person. He had provided the police with evidence against me. If they caught me they wouldn t just have buried me. They would ve hanged me to death. So he ran away from Rudrapur and took refuge in Gandhargarh. Then I took on a new name... Sasikanta Bharadwaj. Soon I had fame glory respect. But Master always maintained ties with Rudrapur. When Hemanta was in police custody... one of our followers saw the symbol of the rudrabina on his back. He had informed us about it. I ve told you the secrets of your master. I know that your peers are defaming you. You were meant to receive the national music award this year. But Ranjan Ghosh got it instead of you. Don t you want revenge Yes I do. Then This is your golden opportunity. Join us. What do I have to do First of all tell us... who else among your peers has this symbol on their body Um... Yes... An old servant of the house called Anadi. So you forced Anadi... to reveal all the names and had them murdered. You also verified the names with a DNA test right Wow You know this as well I ve never seen a detective who sings. Yes I did it. I did it because unnecessary bloodshed goes against our morality. My goodness Morality Isn t lying against your morality You knew nothing about the notation. You lied. I admit it... I admit I lied to you. Amanat Khan used his brains to compose it. You used your brains to find it. And I used my brains to copy it. What a brilliant composition You re... You re such a renowned musician. You re our country s pride. But you re so greedy. Greedy No. I m not that greedy. Believe me. It s just that... I m greedy for my life. The fame glory and wealth which I ve earned throughout my life... I want it all forever. I m scared of death. I can t share my glory with anyone. I can t share it. I m the absolute authority of Rudrapur. Huge as the Himalayas. Vast as the seas. That s why I want Tansen s Raga Sanjivani. I ll... I ll be immortal. I ll be immortal. I know that it s not possible. But I crave it. It s the only thing I want. I want to be immortal. An artist becomes immortal through his creations. A greedy person like you can never create something. I know that I know everything. I ve seen the world long before you. I know that an artist becomes immortal through his creations. You can t create something with a greedy mind. But this coming from a foolish guy like you is funny. It s funny. This is the Shiva lake. Let s see you if you can find Raga Sanjivani here. Look for it. In the heart of Rudrapur lies a Shiva lake. When the discs are aligned And the notes are played at twice the pace of time Raga Sanjivani you shall find. I know all that. We ve followed the notation but nothing happened. You people play it now. The discs are already in place. Start playing. What s this Bahadur This was designed by Madhubanti s grandfather. Came to know about it from the map of the temple. Basically if the instruments are played according to this notation... then we ll find Raga Sanjivani. And the notes are played at twice the pace of time Raga Sanjivani you shall find. Hmm. But why at twice the pace of time Look Shruti. The normal tempo of time is beats per minute. So twice the pace of time would be... Sixty into two. As in beats per minute. Right So basically... if the notation is played at beats per minute on every instrument then we ll find Raga Sanjivani. Sarod. Sitar. Flute. Santoor. Shehnai. Sarangi rudrabina. I get it. But who will play the rudrabina A whore will play the rudrabina Is there any other way But... But... H How did Rohini learn to play the rudrabina Pandit Kedar Mishra secretly taught you to play the rudrabina. Isn t it Mom Hmmph Rohini... the rudrabina is the king of all instruments. Earlier... maestros taught the rudrabina only to their sons or sons in law. At my first music school... girls were forbidden to touch the rudrabina. But I don t obey these rules now. Among my students... you re the only one who is worthy of learning the rudrabina. But... you need a pure mind to play the rudrabina. If you play it with an impure mind... a curse will befall you. Nobody can escape the curse. Nobody. What happened Master Hmm My master Amanat Khan... gave me special instructions while teaching the rudrabina. He asked me to teach you the rudrabina.
